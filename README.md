# Optimal Autonomous 3D Terrain Navigation
A simulation framework to compare and evaluate the performance of four classical search algorithms—A*, Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best-First Search, and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT)—for autonomous navigation over realistic 3D terrains modeled using hexagonal grid geometry.

## Overview

This project investigates the effectiveness of graph-based and sampling-based algorithms for navigating through procedurally generated 3D terrains. Terrain data is generated using **Perlin Noise**, and each hexagonal cell contains an elevation value influencing the movement cost. The goal is to identify the most efficient algorithm for real-time autonomous navigation across complex environments.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **A\***  
  Combines cost-so-far `g(n)` and heuristic `h(n)` to find near-optimal paths efficiently.  
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  
  Explores the lowest cumulative cost path without heuristic guidance.  
- **Greedy Best-First Search**  
  Explores nodes with the lowest heuristic value, focusing on speed over optimality.  
- **Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT)**  
  Random sampling-based approach suitable for dynamic and high-dimensional spaces.

##  Terrain Generation

- **Grid Model**: Hexagonal grid for realistic navigation.
- **Elevation**: Generated using Perlin noise to simulate realistic hills and valleys.
- **Movement Cost**: Depends on elevation change between neighboring hex cells:
  - Uphill → Penalty applied
  - Downhill → Bonus applied

## Evaluation Metrics

### For Algorithms:
- **Path Length**: Number of steps in the generated path.
- **Path Cost**: Accumulated terrain-aware movement cost.
- **Computation Time**: Time taken to find the path.
- **Nodes Expanded**: Number of states visited.

### For Terrains:
- **Elevation Range**: Difference between min and max elevation.
- **Elevation Variance**: Measures surface roughness.
- **Obstacle Density**: % of grid cells exceeding an elevation threshold.
- **Local Roughness**: Average elevation change between neighbors.
